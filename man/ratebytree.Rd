\usage{
ratebytree(trees, x, ...)
\method{posthoc}{ratebytree}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
	\item{trees}{an object of class \code{"multiPhylo"}.}
	\item{x}{a list of trait vectors for a continuous trait in which the names of each vectors correspond to the tip labels of \code{trees}. In the case of \code{posthoc.ratebytree}, an object of class \code{"ratebytree"}.}
	\item{...}{optional arguments, including the argument \code{type} (\code{"continuous"} or \code{"discrete"}), which, if not specified, the function will attempt to ascertain. For continuous character, optional arguments presently include the following: \code{model}, the model of continuous trait evolution (options are \code{"BM"}, the default, \code{"OU"}, and \code{"EB"}); \code{tol}, used as a minimum value for the fitting rates, to prevent problems in optimization; \code{trace}, a logical value indicating whether or not to report progress in the optimization; \code{test}, the method for hypothesis testing (options are \code{"chisq"} and \code{"simulation"}); \code{quiet}, a logical value indicating whether or not to run perfectly quietly; and \code{se}, a list of vectors containing the standard errors for each value of \code{x}. For \code{type="discrete"} the optional arguments are slightly different. The argument \code{model} can be used, but it must assume the values \code{"ER"}, \code{"SYM"}, \code{"ARD"}, or a numeric matrix following \code{\link{ace}}. Other optional arguments are not yet available.}

\description{
	This function essentially implements two different methods for comparing the rate or process of evolution between trees: one for continuously-valued traits, and a second for discrete characters.
	
	In both cases, the function takes an object of class \code{"multiPhylo"} containing two or more phylogenies (\code{trees}), and a list of trait vectors (\code{x}).

	For continuous traits, the function then proceeds to fit two models: one in which the rate (or regime, for models \code{"OU"} and \code{"EB"}) of trait evolution is equal among all trees; and a second in which the rates or regimes can differ between trees.
	
	The latter model corresponds to an extension the \emph{censored} approach of O'Meara et al. (2006; \emph{Evolution}) and should also be related to the method of Adams (2012; \emph{Systematic Biology}) for comparing rates among traits. See \code{\link{brownie.lite}} for a different implementation of the \emph{noncensored} approach of O'Meara et al. (2006).
	
	For discrete traits, the function instead proceeds to fit two variants of the M<i>k</i> model: one in which the parameters values (transition rates) of the process are free to vary between trees, and a second in which they are fixed to be the same. 
	
	The method \code{posthoc} conducts a post-hoc comparison of parameter estimates between trees in the multi-rate or multi-process model. The parameter that is compared depends on the fitted model. For instance, in \code{model="BM"} posthoc comparison is made of \code{sig2}; if \code{model="OU"} fitted values of \code{alpha} are compared; and so on. The argument \code{p.adjust.method} can be used to specify a method for adjusting P-values for multiple tests following \code{p.adjust} (defaults to \code{p.adjust.method="none"}.
}
\details{
	At present it is not possible to specify different models to fit for the different trees - although if (for instance) character evolution on tree 1 proceeded by a strong \emph{OU} process while character evolution on tree 2 was by \emph{BM}, we would probably reject a constant-process model and tree 2 should show a very low value of \code{alpha}.
	
	To compute the standard errors for each fitted paramater value, the function computes the negative inverse of the Hessian matrix at the MLEs; however, if this matrix is computationally singular generalized inverse (\code{\link{ginv}}) will be used instead without warning.

	The function also conducts a likelihood-ratio test to compare the two models.
